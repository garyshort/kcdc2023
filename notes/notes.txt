PENIS
- P is for parameter
-- prediction = model + error
--- model is mostly regression when dealing with people
---- regression is something like y = b1x1 + b2x3 .. + bnXn + C
--- error is just the difference between the predicted outcome and the observed outcome
--- and describes the "fit" of the model, then lower the error then the better the 'fit'
---- to get total error we could sum the errors
---- but postive and negitive variance would cancel out
---- so we square the errors and then sum them (SS)
---- but the size of the error would then be a function of how many obserations we made
---- so we take the mean sum squared error (MSE)
---- but now we have an issue that the MSE is in unit squared and so we have to take the
---- root to express the value in the original unit... this is called the standard deviation.
- E is for Estimation
-- Estimate using method of least squares
--- Draw U graph using formaula error = observed value - prediction
---- use mean, say mean of friends was 2.6, guess the mean to be different values
---- calculate the sum of squared error and then plot prediction of mean vs sum of squared errors
---- show the correct prediction was the one at the bottom of the U.
